Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) was a German philosopher whose work is associated with phenomenology and existentialism. His ideas have had a major influence on contemporary European philosophy and have had an impact on other fields such as architecture, literary criticism, theology, psychotherapy, and cognitive science. He was born in Messkirch, Germany in 1889 and studied theology at the University of Freiburg before switching to philosophy in 1911. He began teaching at Freiburg in 1915. His later philosophy includes the Turn and Contributions to Philosophy, Appropriation, Dwelling and the Fourfold, Technology, Safeguarding, and Only a God can Save Us. Martin Heidegger was a philosopher who married Elfride Petri and had two sons. He was influenced by Brentano, Aristotle, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Dilthey, and Husserl. Heidegger's magnum opus, Being and Time, was dedicated to Husserl and published in 1927. It is considered one of the most significant texts in contemporary European philosophy. Being and Time by Heidegger has had a major influence on many later European philosophical ideas, including Sartre's existentialism, Gadamer's hermeneutics, and Derrida's deconstruction. Heidegger joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and was elected Rector of Freiburg University, where he either enthusiastically implemented Nazi policy or conducted a partially underground campaign of resistance. After 1934, he became increasingly distanced from Nazi politics and was banned from teaching after the war. He regained his teaching rights in 1949 and was made professor Emeritus one year later. Heidegger's later writings do not provide a clear repudiation of National Socialism. His philosophy underwent a reorienting shift known as 'the turn' which is difficult to define and dates back to 1930-1940s. His second greatest work, Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), was written in 1936-1937 and published in 1989. Heidegger died in 1976 and was buried in Messkirch. Being and Time is a long and complex book. Heidegger's language in Being and Time is difficult to understand, but is ultimately justified by the realization that conventional terms and linguistic constructions are inadequate to express his ideas. Heidegger's philosophical work before the writing of Being and Time is seen as the pre-history of the text, and his central theme was his complex relationship with Husserl's transcendental phenomenology. Heidegger argued that Husserl's view of philosophy was flawed because the givenness of objects was a theoretical construct. Heidegger's thinking developed to include a neo-Aristotelian search for what unites and makes possible our senses of being, a transformation of Husserl's transcendental consciousness into Dasein, and a replacement of Husserlian intentionality with the concept of care or Being-in-the-world. Heidegger's framework in Being and Time is based on a radical reinterpretation of Aristotle's idea that meaningful appearances of beings involve an event in which a human being takes a being as something. Heidegger suggests that taking-as is grounded in a temporal unity that characterizes Being-in-the-world (care). This engagement with Aristotle explains why Aristotle appears on almost every page of Being and Time. Heidegger's pre-Being-and-Time period is discussed in various works, as well as the philosophical relationship between Husserl and Heidegger. Heidegger raises the fundamental question of what "to exist" means, which is known as the question of the meaning of Being. Heidegger's translators capitalize the word "Being" to mark the ontological difference between Being and beings (entities). Being is not a higher-order being, but rather the Being of some entity. Capitalizing the word "Being" helps to avoid this mistake. Heidegger believes that Western philosophy has failed to recognize the ontological difference, and has instead treated Being as a kind of ultimate being. He sets out to recover the question of the meaning of Being by drawing two distinctions between different kinds of inquiry: the ontical and the ontological, and regional ontology and fundamental ontology. The ontical presupposes the regional-ontological, which in turn presupposes the fundamental-ontological. Heidegger introduces the notion of Dasein to answer the question of the meaning of Being. It is interpreted as Heidegger's label for the distinctive mode of Being realized by human beings, or as Heidegger's term for the distinctive kind of entity that human beings as such are. It is important to be careful about what sort of entity is being discussed. Heidegger argues that Dasein is a way of life shared by members of a community, and that humans are special because they are able to encounter the question of what it means to be, and reflect upon it. They also operate in their everyday activities with an understanding of Being, and lead their lives in a way that is different from inanimate objects and non-human animals. Heidegger's concept of Dasein emphasizes that each moment in a human life is a branch-point at which a person can choose a kind of life. This choice can be made by continuing unthinkingly along an existing path, giving us a sense of human freedom. Dasein's projects and possibilities are connected to the ways in which other entities become intelligible. The 'Da' of Da-sein can be translated as 'open', meaning an openness to Being that allows us to encounter beings in particular ways. The term 'Da' is often translated as 'there', but it can also be interpreted as 'having-to-be-open'. This idea of openness is a necessary characteristic of human beings, and it is expressed through the ability to take-other-beings-as. Dasein stands out in two senses: it can observe itself, and it can open itself to Being. This helps to explain Heidegger's claim that Dasein, and only Dasein, exists. Heidegger argues that Dasein's preontological understanding of Being, which is revealed in its everyday encounters with entities, is the foundation and motivation for ontology. Heidegger's adopted method of investigation is a species of phenomenology, which is not the study of how things appear in experience, but rather the examination of Dasein's everyday encounters with entities. Heidegger follows Husserl in conceiving of phenomenology as a theoretical enterprise that takes ordinary experience as its point of departure, but which aims to reveal the a priori, transcendental conditions that shape and structure it. Heidegger claims that phenomenology is not just transcendental, but also hermeneutic, meaning its goal is to deliver an interpretation of Being that is guided by certain historically embedded ways of thinking and is open to revision. Being and Time has a spiral structure in which a sequence of reinterpretations produces an ever more illuminating comprehension of Being. Heidegger argues that we usually encounter entities as equipment, and that our closest relationship with them is achieved by skillfully manipulating them. He also suggests that the hermeneutic conception of phenomenology is at odds with the project of uncovering the a priori transcendental conditions that make possible particular modes of Being. Contemporary Heidegger scholarship is divided on whether to emphasize the transcendental or hermeneutic dimension of Heidegger's phenomenology. Heidegger's concept of readiness-to-hand describes the distinctive kind of Being that entities possess when they are used in skilled activity. In such contexts, tools-in-use become phenomenologically transparent and the carpenter has no conscious recognition of the hammer, nails, or work-bench. Moreover, the carpenter has no awareness of himself as a subject over and against a world of objects. This does not mean that Dasein's behaviour is automatic, but rather that the awareness present is non-subject-object in form. Heidegger denies that the categories of subject and object characterize our most basic way of encountering entities, but maintains that they apply to a derivative kind of encounter. He calls this mode of Being presence-at-hand, and refers to present-at-hand entities as 'Things'. The final phenomenological category identified is un-readiness-to-hand, which emerges when skilled practical activity is disturbed by broken or malfunctioning equipment, discovered-to-be-missing equipment, or in-the-way equipment. These entities are not yet the fully fledged objects of the present-at-hand, since their status is defined relative to a particular equipmental context. Heidegger's account of the un-ready-to-hand suggests that Dasein's practical problem solving involves a spectrum of cases characterized by different modes and degrees of engagement/disengagement. In the limit, Dasein's problem solving activity will approximate the theoretical reasoning of scientific inquiry, but even then Dasein is not completely disengaged. This spectrum of cases raises a potential worry for Heidegger's account. Cappuccio and Wheeler argue that skilled activity is rarely perfectly smooth, and that a minimal subject-object dichotomy is characteristic of cases of un-readiness-to-hand. Christensen defends an alternative reading of Heidegger, according to which Dasein always exists as a subject relating to the world via representations. Christensen argues that Heidegger's rejection of the thought that Dasein's access to the world is always theoretical does not necessarily mean that Dasein's access to the world is not in the mode of a representing subject. Heidegger argues that Dasein is always Being-in-the-world, and that this is an essential characteristic of Dasein. Heidegger states that Dasein is never "free from Being-in" and that taking up relationships towards the world is only possible because Dasein is already Being-in-the-world. Heidegger introduces the concept of "involvement" (Bewandtnis) to explain how Dasein is essentially in the world. This is not a merely spatial relation, but rather a sense of belonging and familiarity. Involvement is not a stand-alone structure, but rather a link in a network of intelligibility called a totality of involvements. Heidegger's example of a hammer being used to make something fast to protect against bad weather is used to illustrate his concept of "equipmental practice". This practice is based on a relational ontology, which suggests that the hammer is only intelligible in relation to the shelter and other items of equipment it is related to. This leads to a "strong systematicity condition" and a large-scale holistic network of interconnected relational significance, which Heidegger calls a "world" in an ontical sense. Heidegger also notes that involvements are not uniform structures. The text discusses how the author is using a computer in their office to write an encyclopedia entry about Heidegger's philosophy. According to Heidegger, all totalities of involvements have a link of this type at their base, which explains the idea that each moment in Dasein's existence constitutes a branch-point at which it chooses a way to be. This is because every for-the-sake-of-which is the base structure of an equipment-defining totality of involvements and reflects a possible way for Dasein to be. Disturbances have the effect of exposing totalities of involvements and, therefore, worlds. Heidegger uses the term "world" to refer to an abstract network mode of organizational configuration shared by all concrete totalities of involvements. Heidegger then uses this concept to critique Descartes' view of the world as a collection of present-at-hand entities to be encountered by subjects. Heidegger argues that this view presupposes a more fundamental openness to Being that he has identified as an essential characteristic of Dasein. Heidegger argues that we do not start with context-independent present-at-hand primitives, but rather with equipment that is already laden with context-dependent significance. Heidegger claims that we start with the ready-to-hand, and move to the present-at-hand by stripping away the holistic networks of everyday equipmental meaning. Heidegger argues that adding value-predicates to present-at-hand primitives cannot transform our encounters with those objects into encounters with equipment. Descartes' defender might concede that present-at-hand entities have determinate properties, but wonder why the fact that an entity has determinate properties is necessarily an indication of presence-at-hand. Heidegger's argument is incomplete and the defender of Cartesianism might suggest that involvements can be thought of as determinate features that entities possess when embedded in certain contexts of use. Heidegger argues that Dasein's existential spatiality cannot be a matter of being located at a particular co-ordinate in physical, Cartesian space. Heidegger's concept of de-severance is used to explain this, which is a bringing close that makes the remoteness of something disappear. Dreyfus (1990) suggests that value-predicates constitute a form of knowing-that, while the circumspective knowledge of totalities of involvements constitute a form of knowing-how. Heidegger proposes that spatiality is intimately related to the 'reach' of Dasein's skilled practical activity, and that physical, Cartesian space is possible as something meaningful for Dasein only because Dasein has de-severance as one of its existential characteristics. Malpas (forthcoming) rejects this account of spatiality given in Being and Time. Malpas argues that equipmental space (a space ordered in terms of practical activity and within which an agent acts) presupposes a more fundamental notion of space as a complex unity with objective, intersubjective and subjective dimensions. Heidegger in Being and Time links embodiment with Thinghood, but does not make a distinction between material and lived ways in which Dasein is embodied. It is suggested that Dasein's existential spatiality depends on its embodiment, rather than the other way around. Heidegger argues that existential space is derived from temporality, but there is reason to think that the dependency may actually go the other way, with temporality being dependent on existential spatiality. Heidegger rejects the idea of Dasein as a Cartesian 'I-thing', and instead suggests that equipment is often revealed to us as being for the sake of other Dasein. Heidegger argues that to be Dasein means to Be-with, and that Being-with is the a priori transcendental condition for loneliness. He explains that Others are those from whom one does not distinguish oneself, and that the world is always the one that is shared with Others. Heidegger cites data that each society has its own sense of what counts as an appropriate distance to stand from someone during verbal communication, which varies depending on the relationship and the environment. This text discusses the idea that the phenomenon of the "Others" in everyday life is culturally specific and that the norms of behavior are determined by "what one does" in a particular culture. It also explains that the "for-the-sake-of-which" structure of each totality of involvements is culturally and historically conditioned. This means that Dasein's everyday world is a shared world and that Being-with and Being-in-the-world are intertwined. Heidegger's notion of Being-with has been criticized for ignoring or misunderstanding the fundamental character of our social existence, which is grounded in direct interpersonal interaction. Heidegger's account of Dasein discovering socially shared equipmental meaning does not explain why this must be the case, and processes of direct interpersonal contact may fill this gap. Heidegger's response is to claim that these processes are not a priori, transcendental structures of Dasein, but rather psychological factors that enable human beings to realize the phenomenon of Being-with. However, it is questionable whether these social processes can be relegated to the status of 'mere' enabling factors. Heidegger's notion of Being-with is incomplete, so he reformulates it in terms of thrownness, projection, fallen-ness, disposedness, understanding, and fascination. This is referred to as care, which is connected to the three temporal dimensions of past, future, and present. Dasein is thrown into the world and has a receptiveness to it, which is why it matters to them. Heidegger argues that moods are not subjective inner states, but rather aspects of being in the world. He also suggests that moods have a social character, and that the repertoire of world-disclosing moods is culturally conditioned. Disposedness is the a priori transcendental condition for moods. Heidegger's treatment of moods has been used to identify and understand certain affective phenomena, called 'existential feelings', which can help us to understand various forms of psychiatric illness. Dasein is a delicate balance of determination and freedom, and understanding is the process by which Dasein projects itself onto possibilities delineated by totalities of involvements. Understanding is manifested as skilled activity, interpretation, and linguistic assertion. Dasein's practices of understanding and interpretation are projectively oriented manifestations of the taking-as activity that forms the existential core of Dasein's Being. This is known as the hermeneutic circle and is the "essential fore-structure of Dasein itself". Thrownness, projection, and fallen-ness are the three dimensions of care. Fallen-ness is manifested in idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity, which obscures the world and leads to a "Being-lost in the publicness of the 'they'". This is known as levelling or averageness. Heidegger's distinction between the authentic self and its inauthentic counterpart is explored. The authentic self is the self that is owned by the individual, while the inauthentic self is the self lost to the 'they'. Fallen-ness is an essential part of our Being, and is not an accidental feature, but rather part of Dasein's existential constitution. Achieving a state of authenticity does not involve re-establishing a self-sufficient individual subject. Heidegger argues that authenticity is not about being isolated from others, but rather about finding a different way of relating to them. In Division 2 of Being and Time, Heidegger shifts the focus of the analysis from the inauthentic self (the they-self) to the authentic self (the mine-self). Heidegger argues that understanding Dasein's relation to death is essential to understanding Dasein as a whole, but since one cannot experience one's own death, it seems that the kind of phenomenological analysis that has hitherto driven the argument of Being and Time breaks down. Heidegger suggests that Dasein understands death through experiencing the death of others, but this falls short of what is needed. Heidegger explains that we cannot experience the loss of Being that the dead person has suffered, but we can relate to our own death as an inevitable possibility. Death is tied to each individual Dasein, and is the moment at which all our relations to others disappear. Heidegger's account of Dasein's relation to the possibility of its own not-Being forms the basis of a reinterpretation of the phenomenon of care. Care is now interpreted in terms of Being-towards-death, meaning that Dasein has an internal relation to the nothing. Heidegger argues that Being-towards-death has the three-dimensional character of care and is realized in both authentic and inauthentic modes. Awareness of one's own death as an omnipresent possibility discloses the authentic self and illuminates Dasein in its totality. Heidegger introduces the term "anticipation" to describe the projection of a possible way to be, specifically in the case of death. Anxiety is a mode of disposedness that reveals the possibility of one's own not-Being-in-the-world, and thus the possibility of one's own individualized Being. Heidegger reinterpreted two of the three dimensions of care in the light of Dasein's essential finitude, but the third dimension, fallen-ness, cannot be a feature of this realization of care. Everyday Dasein's fallen-ness manifests itself in its evasion of the meaning of its own death, which is determined by the 'they'. This evasion does not necessarily mean refusing to acknowledge death, but the certainty of death achieved by idle talk is of the wrong sort. Heidegger argues that death can never be actual for us, so any actual death cannot be our own. Fear can only disclose particular oncoming events, while anxiety discloses our own death. Expectation is waiting for a case of death, while anticipation is owning it. Heidegger reinterprets care in terms of Being-towards-death, which is an essential characteristic of human existence due to our finitude. Heidegger's analysis of death is questioned by Sartre, who argues that death is not a possibility for Dasein, but rather a nihilation of all possibilities. Heidegger's project is incomplete without a way to complete the phenomenological analysis of Dasein. Heidegger's key notion of anticipatory resoluteness is identified as an authentic mode of care, in which one looks forward to a possible way to be. Heidegger's reinterpretation of the authentic self is characterized by Being-guilty, which is not a psychological feeling but a disclosive phenomenon. The call of conscience interrupts Dasein's everyday fascination with entities by summoning it back to its own finitude and authenticity. Heidegger argues that conscience has the structure of care, which is composed of projection, thrownness and discourse. Heidegger's view of discourse is somewhat unclear, as it could mean that intelligibility is a linguistic phenomenon, or that discourse is intelligibility put into language, or even that discourse is any way of articulating the referential structure of significance. Heidegger also suggests that discourse can have inauthentic modes, such as idle talk, and that fallen-ness can have an authentic manifestation called a moment-of-vision. The relationship between discourse, fallen-ness, and authenticity is not entirely clear. Authentic care involves reticence, taking responsibility for one's own lack or not-Being, and anxiety, which all extract Dasein from the ontological clutches of the 'they'. Resoluteness is a new term for reticence-guilt-anxiety and is connected to authenticity and freedom. It involves committing oneself to a project and taking ownership of one's life, which inauthentic Dasein avoids. Authentic Being (resoluteness) is a freedom from the 'they' which involves individual commitment to and ownership of one of the possible ways to be that one's socio-cultural embeddedness makes available. Resoluteness is not a conscious decision-making process, but an occurrence that discloses Dasein's essential finitude. Heidegger argues that resoluteness and anticipation are internally related, emerging together as the unitary phenomenon of anticipatory resoluteness. This requires an authentic awareness of the possibility of death, which is anticipation. Heidegger's notion of resoluteness allows him to rethink the path to Dasein's essential finitude, which is the condition of possibility for the taking-as structure that is a constitutive aspect of Dasein. Heidegger concludes that temporality is the a priori transcendental condition for there to be care, and it is Dasein's openness to time that allows Dasein's potential authenticity to be actualized. Heidegger's treatment of time is an echo and development of Kant's claim that embeddedness in time is a precondition for things to appear to us the way they do, but Heidegger is not concerned with clock-time or time as a relativistic phenomenon. Heidegger introduces the concept of ecstases, which are phenomena that stand out from an underlying unity, to explain the internal feature of Dasein's existential constitution. He reinterprets ecstases as horizons, which limit, surround, and enclose, and disclose or make available. Temporality is a unity against which past, present, and future stand out as ecstases while remaining interlocked. Heidegger argues that for each of Dasein's phenomena, one particular dimension of temporality is primary, with projection being disclosed principally as the manner in which Dasein orients itself towards its future. Heidegger's analysis of the care structure of Dasein (human existence) identifies anticipation as the predominantly futural aspect of authentic temporalizing, and expectation as the predominantly futural aspect of inauthentic temporalizing. Thrownness is identified predominantly as the manner in which Dasein collects up its past, while fallen-ness and discourse are identified predominantly as present-oriented. Authentic and inauthentic temporalizing are understood as prioritizing different dimensions of temporality. Heidegger argues that future-directed anticipation is intertwined with projection onto death, enabling the disclosure of Dasein's finitude, and that each event of intelligibility that makes up a 'moment' in Dasein's existence must be unpacked using all three temporal ecstases (thrownness, projection, and falling/discourse). This explains why the future is not later than having been, and having-been is not earlier than the present. Dasein's essential temporality provides the a priori transcendental condition for there to be care, the sense-making that constitutes Dasein's own distinctive mode of Being. Heidegger identifies a phenomenon called Dasein's historicality, which is the a priori condition on the basis of which past events and things may have significance for us. This phenomenon is not to be interpreted as a biological event, but as a moment of enculturation, in which a biological human being is embedded within a pre-existing world. This world is to be reinterpreted historically as Dasein's heritage, which brings the past alive in the present as a set of opportunities for future action. Heidegger calls this phenomenon Wiederholung, which is translated as repetition. Heidegger's concept of 'repetition' does not mean that one must repeat the actions of their cultural ancestors, but rather that they can creatively appropriate them as models or templates. This idea of 'retrieving' is connected to Dasein's historizing, which is an a priori structure of Dasein's Being as care. It is debatable whether this idea of creative appropriation allows for individual freedom, as Heidegger's concept of heritage may introduce a threat of social determinism. Additionally, an earlier passage in Being and Time may suggest that any attempt to take on board elements of cultures other than one's own is inauthentic. Heidegger argues that understanding and synthesizing different cultures leads to a genuine understanding of oneself. He believes that freedom is achieved through recognizing one's finitude and heritage, and authentically appropriating it. Heidegger also introduces the concept of primordial historizing, which is shared by a community and is linked to its destiny. This concept has been interpreted as having dark undertones of cultural chauvinism and racial prejudice. In his 1933 rectoral address at Freiburg University, Heidegger argued that knowledge service, labour service, and military service are all original aspects of the German essence. Heidegger's later relationship with Nazi politics and ideology is complex, but his view in Being and Time is that understanding is never preconception-free and that authentic Dasein should be individualized. This does not necessarily lead to an extreme form of subjectivist relativism. Heidegger's philosophical framework in Being and Time appears to suggest a kind of cultural relativism, where worlds are culturally relative phenomena, but nature as it is in itself is not. Nature can be discovered as ready-to-hand equipment, determined by our socially conditioned patterns of skilled practical activity, or as present-at-hand, by science, with an essentially cross-cultural character. Heidegger suggests that there are culture-independent causal properties of nature which explain why certain things can be made out of certain materials, and that these properties and processes are what he calls the Real. Heidegger's position can be seen as a mild form of scientific realism, where science reveals natural entities as they are independently of Dasein's culturally conditioned uses and articulations of them. Heidegger's two claims that Being is dependent on the understanding of Being and that only when Dasein exists is there Being, are consistent with each other. This relates to Heidegger's account of truth, which adds a new dimension to the phenomenon of revealing. Heidegger argues that truth is not only found in the correspondence between propositions and states of affairs, but also in the prior field of intelligibility established by Dasein, which he calls "original truth". He also suggests a third manifestation of truth, located between original truth and propositional truth. Heidegger's notion of truth is that it can be manifested not only through words, but also through skilled practical activity. This has led to a dispute in Heidegger scholarship, with some arguing that Dasein's understanding of Being is simply identified with skilled practical activity, which is known as the pragmatist interpretation. Critics of this interpretation argue that it does not fully capture Heidegger's account of truth, as it does not take into account the fundamental variety of truth beyond propositional correspondence. The critic points out that instrumental truth is dependent on a prior field of significance and original truth, and that not all pragmatist readings are equal in this regard. Tugendhat argues that original truth fails to qualify as a form of truth because it does not accommodate a distinction between what is asserted or intended and how things are in themselves. Tugendhat argues that unconcealing, while a genuine phenomenon that is necessary for truth, is not itself a species of truth. Heidegger's framework of unconcealing and reality may threaten scientific realism, as it implies that propositional and instrumental truths are relativistically tied to a particular culture and time period. Heidegger suggests that even scientific truth is subject to this relativistic constraint, meaning that contemporary and alchemical chemistry may both be true. Despite this, there is still room for some form of realism. Heidegger's view supports a historically conditioned form of Kantian empirical realism with respect to science, but rejects the idea that science is regulated by progress towards a final set of truths. Heidegger prioritizes authenticity as the road to understanding the meaning of Being, but this raises the question of how ahistorical, universal conditions are possible given Dasein's essential historicality. Heidegger claims that nature is only intelligible to us in Dasein-time, and that even when we theoretically investigate nature, the time remains the same Dasein-time, meaning that present-at-hand time is also Dasein-dependent. This creates a snag for the attempt to see Heidegger as a realist. Heidegger argues that nature is outside of time and cannot be understood by humans due to its atemporality. He later shifted his thinking, which he called "the turn," due to his failure to complete the third division of Being and Time. This turn was a reversal of his previous thinking and was difficult to express due to the language of metaphysics. It was experienced from the fundamental experience of the oblivion of Being. Heidegger's later philosophy shares the same preoccupation with Being and our relationship with it as his earlier work, but he abandons the transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology of Being and Time, which focused on Dasein, because he believes it bears the stain of a subjectivity that blocks the path to an understanding of Being. Heidegger's later philosophy is distributed over a large number of works, including books, lecture courses, and occasional addresses. The strategy adopted to understand it is to view it through the lens of his work Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning). Heidegger asked for the work not to appear in print until after the publication of all his lecture courses, and it was not published in German until 1989 and not in English until 1999. Heidegger's later writings were seen as training material to understand his earlier work, and he only showed the Contributions to a few close colleagues. When it was eventually published, it was met with excitement due to the influence of Otto Pöggeler, who described it as the work in which Heidegger's genuine and complete thinking is captured. The structure of the Contributions is organised like a musical fugue, and the language can appear to be wilfully obscurantist. Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy is a difficult text that is written in a poetic style that leaves behind the idea of representing Being accurately with scientific language. The text sets the agenda for Heidegger's post-turn thought and explores four main themes: Being as appropriation, technology, safeguarding, and the gods. These themes are connected to a reinterpretation of the notion of dwelling and are based on the a priori transcendental condition of temporality from Being and Time. In later philosophy, the focus of ontology shifts to the idea that human Being fundamentally consists of dwelling. This shift is due to a reformulation of the question of Being, which now asks how Being unfolds instead of what its meaning is. Being is understood as a timebound, historical process, and the key move in the Contributions is a rethinking of Being in terms of the notion of Ereignis, which is translated as "event", "appropriation", "appropriating event", "event of appropriation", or "enowning". Heidegger argues that Being appropriates Dasein, which enables Being to unfold. This appropriation is not to be interpreted as a mystical relationship, but rather as a form of dwelling. This dwelling is a way of being in the world that is unique to Dasein. Each transformation of Dasein is a revolution in human patterns of intelligibility. Heidegger's reinterpretation of dwelling in terms of Being as appropriation is intertwined with a reinterpretation of what is meant by a world. Heidegger's 1954 piece, Building Dwelling Thinking, explains that human being consists in dwelling on the earth, under the sky, before the divinities, and belonging to men's being with one another. This primal oneness of the four elements (earth and sky, divinities and mortals) is what grounds Heidegger's existential notion of spatiality. Heidegger's concept of the fourfold is an integrated combination of nature (earth and sky) and culture (divinities and mortals). It is important to note that the fourfold is not a straightforward identification of nature and culture, as Heidegger's description of the earth and sky in Building Dwelling Thinking makes clear. Heidegger's language suggests that the earth and sky are spaces for a poetic mode of habitation by humans. To dwell among mortals is to be capable of death, and to dwell before the divinities is to understand the cultural and historical character of intelligibility. This reworking of the idea of the nothing ultimately marks out a newly conceived non-evasive relationship with death as an aspect of dwelling, understood in terms of poetic habitation. According to Being and Time, the a priori transcendental conditions for intelligibility are culturally determined structures that form pre-existing fields of intelligibility into which individual human beings are thrown and onto which they project themselves. Heidegger suggests that a secularized sense of the sacred can be restored through a transformational event, and that the mystery of alternative fields of intelligibility can be accessed through poetic habitation. Heidegger's later philosophy introduces the concept of Being, which is an essential aspect of dwelling and is ontologically co-present with any world. Appropriation is a twofold event, where Dasein is thrown into an intelligible world and vast regions of Being are plunged into darkness. This darkness is necessary for intelligibility, and freedom is what conceals and opens to light. In Heidegger's 1935 essay The Origin of the Work of Art, he writes of a conflict between earth and world, which is explained by the presence of the mystery. Natural materials used in artworks enter into intelligibility by establishing certain culturally codified meanings, while simultaneously suggesting the existence of a vast range of other possible, but to us unintelligible, meanings. Heidegger's idea of the nothing, or mystery, is a positive ontological phenomenon that is necessary for the essential unfolding of Being. This idea is met with disdain by logical positivist Carnap, but it allows Heidegger to rethink our relationship with death in relation to poetic habitation. Being-towards-death is a relation to the possibility of one's own non-existence, and this internal structural relation to the nothing is sheltered and comes to light with a singular keenness due to Dasein's essential finitude. Sheehan (2001) argues that human finitude is what grounds the mystery of the plenitude of possible worlds in which we are not. Heidegger's idea of dwelling involves embeddedness in the fourfold and a necessary relationship with the mystery. To understand this four-way demand, Heidegger claims that modern humans, especially Western humans, systematically fail to meet it, leading to an existential malaise of the oblivion of Being. Heidegger claims that the everyday view of technology as a tool that humans control is only a limited definition. Heidegger reinterprets his earlier notion of intelligibility in terms of the concept of a clearing, which is a region of Being in which things are revealed as mattering in some specific way. Heidegger's claim is that the modern technology reveals entities as a challenging which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as such. Heidegger argues that modern technology views all phenomena, including nature, plants, animals, and humans, as resources to be exploited. He uses the example of a hydroelectric plant built on the Rhine river to illustrate how the technological mode of Being corrupts the notion of unspoilt areas of nature, and how it manifests itself in inter-human affairs, such as turning a friendly chat into networking. Heidegger's point is that the technological mode of Being reduces everything to resources ripe for exploitation. Heidegger argues that technological revealing is not a peripheral aspect of Being, but rather defines our modern way of living in the West. Heidegger rejects the suggestion that technological thinking is merely the practical application of modern mathematical science, arguing instead that the establishment of the technological mode of revealing is a necessary condition for there to be mathematical science at all. O'Neill suggests that good science may depend on the capacity for the disinterested use of the senses, fostering a non-instrumental responsiveness to natural objects as ends rather than as means. Heidegger argues that technology has caused a loss of awe and wonder in the presence of beings, leading to an indifference to this loss. He also suggests that technology can be a stage in the unfolding of Being that can lead to a secularized salvation, by awakening a discovery of the sacred. Heidegger argues that the salvation-bringing transformation of the present condition of human being is not inevitable. Heidegger introduces the concepts of destining and enframing to explain that human history is a temporally organized kaleidoscope of particular ordainings of destining, and enframing is one such ordaining. Heidegger states that humankind is the active agent of technological thinking, but the unconcealment itself is never a human handiwork. Heidegger believes that modern technology is a way of revealing Being's essential unfolding, and that pre-modern artisanship manifests poiesis, a process of gathering and fashioning natural materials in harmony with their environment. Heidegger argues that this is different from the ancient Greeks' use of entities as instrumental means, and that this is why technological thinking defines the spirit of our age. Heidegger introduces the concept of poiesis, which is a process of revealing entities and allowing them to show themselves. He argues that pre-modern society was not dominated by technological thinking, but that enframing has changed this by driving out other possibilities of revealing and covering up the concealing-unconcealing character of appropriation. Heidegger ties this to the idea of technology as metaphysics completing itself, which is grounded in the history of metaphysics. Heidegger believes that the history of Western philosophy has obscured the dynamic of the essential unfolding of Being, culminating in Nietzsche's nihilistic will-to-power. Metaphysics involves the view that there is a single clearing that constitutes reality, which renders thought insensitive to the fundamental structure of Being. Heidegger's later work engages with poetry and adopts a more poetic style of writing in order to think Being historically and to escape the language of metaphysics. Heidegger believes that certain poets, such as Hölderlin, can help us understand the mysterious aspect of Being. Heidegger's intention is to show that the kind of philosophy needed is poetic. Modern humankind has lost sight of how to inhabit the fourfold poetically due to the promotion of instrumentality as the fundamental way of Being of entities. Heidegger's analysis of technology may contribute to contemporary debates in environmental ethics, but he was not an eco-warrior or luddite. He believed that it is not possible to entirely remove technology from modern life, but rather to inhabit it differently. Heidegger argues that in order to enter into safeguarding, humans need to learn to think of Being as a gift that has been granted to them in history. Certain artworks can help disrupt the technological clearing and bring us into contact with the mystery through their expression of dwelling. Safeguarding the fourfold in its essential unfolding is a four-dimensional way of Being. Heidegger's concept of poiesis is central to his idea of saving the earth, which is primarily an ontological project of setting something free into its own essence. This is connected to the idea of dwelling and artisanship, and staying with things in order to cultivate or construct them. This staying with things is the unifying existential structure of safeguarding. Heidegger's main concern is to advocate for the synchronization of contemporary human life with the rhythms of nature. Heidegger's position is not ludditism, but a plea for the use of contemporary machines and devices in a way that is sensitive to the temporal patterns of the natural world. Safeguarding also involves awaiting the divinities as divinities and integrating a non-evasive attitude to death into the cultural structures of the community. Heidegger believes that destining is not a "fate that compels" and that humans have the power to transform their predicament. However, philosophy and other human endeavors cannot effect an immediate transformation of the world. The only possibility left is to prepare for the appearance of a god or for the absence of a god in the time of foundering. Heidegger sometimes uses the term 'god' to refer to a secularized notion of the sacred, which is related to the essential unfolding of Being. Heidegger sometimes refers to a heroic figure or cultural event as a divine catalyst that can initiate a transformational event in the history of Being. Heidegger argues that we are waiting for a god to reawaken us to the poetic and enable us to dwell in the fourfold. This task is complicated by Heidegger's involvement with Nazism, which is debated by scholars such as Farias, Neske and Kettering, Ott, Pattison, Polt, Rockmore, Sluga, Wolin, and Young. Heidegger believed that the German people were destined to lead a spiritual mission to transform the West from a state of instrumental technology to one of poetic dwelling. He believed that the Nazi Party provided the spiritual catalyst to awaken the German nation to its historic mission, and that the German people had a special place in the process due to their inner relationship with the language of the Greeks and their thought. Heidegger believed that the German language was linked to the German people in a special way, and that language was the "house of Being". He was drawn to the Nazi Party because of its image of traditional German rural life, but he rejected the Nazi's biologically grounded racism. He believed that language, not biology, was the essence of man. Heidegger suggested that Africans, plants, and animals have no history, while the event of an airplane carrying Hitler to Mussolini is part of history. Heidegger was disappointed by the spiritual leaders of the Nazi party, believing they were agents of technological thought and thus incapable of completing the historic mission of the German people. Some interpret this as Heidegger believing in an ideal form of Nazism, but others argue that his repudiation of Nazism goes further. Heidegger drew a parallel between modern agriculture and the manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps, which some argue is a devaluing of the Holocaust. Heidegger's involvement with Nazism has caused debate over the extent to which it affects his philosophical work. It is possible to engage with his investigation into Being without looking for evidence of Nazism in his work. Heidegger's collected works in German are published by Vittorio Klostermann, and some of his earliest occasional writings have been translated into English.
