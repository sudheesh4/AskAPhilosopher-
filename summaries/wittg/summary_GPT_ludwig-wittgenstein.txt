Ludwig Wittgenstein is considered one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century and continues to influence philosophical thought today. His works are difficult to interpret, and there are two commonly recognized stages of his thought: the early and the later. The early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_, which showed the application of modern logic to metaphysics. The later Wittgenstein, mostly recognized in the _Philosophical Investigations_, took a more revolutionary step in critiquing traditional philosophy. More recent scholarship has questioned this division, with some claiming a certain unity between all stages of his thought and others talking of a more nuanced division. Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna, Austria in 1889 to a wealthy family. In 1908 he began studying aeronautical engineering at Manchester University, and in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand Russell. During his time in Cambridge, Wittgenstein had conversations on philosophy and the foundations of logic with Russell, Moore, and Keynes. He also spent time in isolation in Norway to ponder philosophical problems. In 1914, at the start of World War I, he joined the Austrian army. Ludwig Wittgenstein was taken captive in 1918 and wrote his first important work, _Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus_, while in prison camp. After the war, he gave away his family's fortune and pursued various professions in Vienna. In 1929, he returned to Cambridge and was exposed to discussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with the Vienna Circle. His conception of philosophy and its problems changed dramatically and this period is known as the 'middle Wittgenstein'. In the 1930s and 1940s, he conducted seminars at Cambridge and developed ideas for his second book, _Philosophical Investigations_. However, he withdrew the final manuscript from publication and only authorized its posthumous publication. Ludwig Wittgenstein's _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ was published in German in 1921 and English in 1922. It was a continuation of and reaction to Russell and Frege's conceptions of logic and language, and was introduced by Russell claiming it was an important event in the philosophical world. Wittgenstein thought little of Russell's introduction, and later interpretations have attempted to uncover the tensions between the introduction and the rest of the book. The structure of the _Tractatus_ is constructed around seven basic propositions, with all other paragraphs numbered by decimal expansions. Wittgenstein's book addresses the central problems of philosophy which deal with the world, thought and language. He proposes that the world is represented by thought, which is a proposition with sense, and that they all share the same logical form. He argues that the world consists of facts rather than objects, and that facts are existent states of affairs which are combinations of objects. Objects are simple, but can fit together in various ways and have various properties and relations. Objects combine with one another based on their internal properties, creating states of affairs that are either actual or possible. Wittgenstein's idea that thoughts and propositions are pictures is used to move to thought and language, with the logical structure of the picture being isomorphic with the logical structure of the state of affairs it pictures. Wittgenstein uses logical calculus to construct his system, and explains that only in the context of a proposition does a name have meaning. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein provides two conditions for sensical language: the structure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of logical form, and the elements of the proposition must have reference. He then provides a vivid presentation of Frege's logic in the form of truth-tables, which can be used to analyze all propositions into their atomic parts. He also provides the general form of a truth-function, which makes use of one formal operation and one propositional variable. Finally, he asserts that all meaningful propositions are of equal value and admonishes what can and should be said, leaving outside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein's goal is to distinguish between sense and nonsense. He argues that only factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be represented by meaningful propositions, leaving out a number of statements which are made and used in language. He further argues that the propositions of logic do not represent states of affairs, and thus do not have sense. These propositions are the limits of language and thought, and therefore the limits of the world. They are senseless. Propositions which do have sense are bipolar, and range within the truth-conditions drawn by the truth-tables. Wittgenstein distinguishes between tautologies and contradictions, which are senseless, and nonsensical propositions, which are even more devoid of meaning. He argues that only what is "in" the world can be described, and anything outside of it is denied meaningfulness. He also makes a distinction between saying and showing, suggesting that what cannot be said can only be shown. This applies to the logical form of the world, the pictorial form, and logical propositions. Wittgenstein argues that philosophy is not a theory or doctrine, but an activity of clarification and critique of language. He suggests that traditional philosophical musings are often nonsensical, and that the philosopher's role is to show this using logical analysis. He also states that all propositions are of equal value, and that the notions used by the Tractatus do not belong to the world and cannot be used to express anything meaningful. The Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative difficulties, and there are several disagreements that inform the map of interpretation. These revolve around the realism of the Tractatus, the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the Tractatus itself, and the reading of the Tractatus as an ethical tract. There are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing realism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects, states of affairs, and facts. Wittgenstein's solution to the tension between language, thought, and the world is to use the metaphor of the ladder to express the function of the Tractatus, which is to be used to "see the world rightly" but then thrown away. The Tractatus has been interpreted in various ways, with some taking a more linguistically-oriented approach and others a more traditional approach. The traditional approach accepted the existence of something beyond language that cannot be put into words, while more recent readings take nonsense more seriously and suggest that the Tractatus should lead us away from the temptation of ineffable truths such as metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. The ethical reading of the Tractatus is based on the discrepancy between the construction of a world-language system in the book and Wittgenstein's comments in the Preface, closing remarks, and a letter to his publisher. Wittgenstein emphasizes the importance of the ineffable, which can be viewed as an ethical position. This has led to interpretative conundrums and debates about the continuity between the early and later Wittgenstein's thought. Wittgenstein's early work was referred to as "dogmatic" because it allowed for a gap between question and answer. His later work rejected this dogmatism and instead focused on the grammar of ordinary language, family resemblances, language-games, and an aphoristic style. This culminated in his posthumously published work, _Philosophical Investigations_, which was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated by Anscombe. In 2009, a new edited translation of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (PI) was published, with Part II labeled as "Philosophy of Psychology - A Fragment". PI is a therapeutic work that critiques traditional ways of thinking about language, truth, thought, intentionality, and philosophy. It begins with a quote from Augustine's Confessions which suggests that words name objects and sentences are combinations of such names. This picture of language is not reliable and cannot do justice to the whole of human language. Wittgenstein proposes a new way of looking at language and philosophy, which is based on the idea that the meaning of a word is its use in the language. He challenges traditional theories of meaning which point to something exterior to the proposition which endows it with sense. He suggests that when investigating meaning, the philosopher must look and see the variety of uses to which the word is put, and compares the functions of words to the functions of tools in a toolbox. Wittgenstein introduces the concept of 'language-games' to emphasize the fluid, diverse, and activity-oriented perspective on language. He uses primitive language-games to illustrate the role of action in establishing meaning, and provides a list of 'regular' language-games in PI 23. He argues that the traditional idea of a proposition housing a content and having a restricted number of Fregean forces should be replaced by a description of use. Wittgenstein's concept of language-games points to the conventional nature of language and the rule-governed character of it. He rejects the idea of looking for one essential core in which the meaning of a word is located and instead suggests looking for a "complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing" to connect particular uses of the same word. He also suggests that family resemblance can be used to show the lack of boundaries and exactness that characterize different uses of the same concept. Wittgenstein's later work focuses on the issue of rule-following, exploring questions such as how we learn and follow rules, and where the standards for correct application come from. He argues against the Platonistic and mentalistic pictures of rules, instead suggesting that no external or internal authority is needed beyond the actual applications of the rule. Wittgenstein's formulation of the problem of following a rule in _PI_ 201 has been widely interpreted and debated, with some arguing that he is voicing a skeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. This has been challenged by other interpretations, while others have provided additional perspectives. The sections following the rule-following sections in _PI_ are thought to be the upshot of the discussion, and point out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible to subject it to public standards and criteria of correctness. Wittgenstein's notion of grammar captures the essence of language as a special rule-governed activity, replacing the stricter and purer logic of the Tractatus. Grammar is not a technical instruction from on-high, but is used to clarify false illusions in cases of philosophical perplexity. An example of this is the grammatical distinction between first-person avowals, which saves us from the blunders of foundational epistemology. Wittgenstein's concept of "forms of life" has given rise to various interpretations, ranging from relativistic to universalistic. He believes that philosophy should not provide theories or explanations, but rather put everything before us for us to view. His later writings emphasize the therapeutic, non-dogmatic nature of philosophy. In the _Investigations_, Wittgenstein rejects the idea of a single philosophical method and instead focuses on marshalling reminders and series of examples to solve different problems. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the temptation of advancing general theses and instead encourages philosophers to focus on the particular case. He also argues that philosophy and science should be kept separate, and that the scientific framework is not appropriate for philosophical investigations. This is in contrast to the _Tractatus_, which advanced one philosophical method. Wittgenstein was aware of the contrast between the two stages of his thought, the _Tractatus_ and the _Investigations_, and suggested publishing them together to make the contrast clear. Both works serve as critiques of language, and Wittgenstein's diagnosis of this is that philosophical problems should disappear. This diagnosis has two implications: the dialogical character of philosophy, and the ability to break off philosophizing when desired. The Tractatus has been interpreted in different ways since its publication, and for two decades after the publication of Philosophical Investigations in 1953, there was wide agreement on the proper way to read the book. Stanley Cavell's Must We Mean What We Say? (1969) and The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy (1979) suggested a more radical emphasis on the particularity of contexts, and argued that meanings are determined only within language games, i.e. only in particular cases. Baker and Hacker's analytical commentary on Wittgenstein's _Investigations_ advocated and developed the orthodox reading of Wittgenstein's later work, which argued that a systematic mapping of the use of our words is necessary to dissolve philosophical problems. This led to two schools of interpretation regarding Wittgenstein's _Tractatus_, one emphasizing the continuity between Wittgenstein's earlier and later writings, and the other emphasizing the resistance to generalization. The debate has to do with the question of ethics and its centrality in reading Wittgenstein's oeuvre. There is a debate between two interpretations of Wittgenstein's work: the traditional approach which sees it as an intellectual investigation with no ethical relevance, and the Cavell approach which sees it as an ethical, cultural, and political endeavor. There are also other interpretations which draw from both sides and attempt a different path. The concept of two Wittgensteins, early and later, has been re-examined and it is now recognized that there is a period between the two, known as the middle Wittgenstein. Scholars are now attempting to answer the questions of the relationship between the early and later Wittgenstein and how to best define the middle Wittgenstein. It is generally accepted that the middle Wittgenstein period is from 1929 to 1944, and some scholars have argued that the middle Wittgenstein can be seen in the early works of Wittgenstein. Various interpretations of the middle Wittgenstein have been proposed, with some pinpointing one year (e.g. 1929 or 1931) and others proposing a few year span (e.g. 1929-1935). The evidence for these interpretations has been the published versions of typescripts/manuscripts of talks and notes from 1929-1936, including "Some Remarks on Logical Form", "A Lecture on Ethics", _Philosophical Remarks_, _Philosophical Grammar_, _The Big Typescript_, the _Blue and Brown Books_, and "Notes for Lectures on 'Private Experience' and 'Sense Data'". Notes taken by participants in Wittgenstein's classes in the early 20th century provide insight into his thought process and the development of his later works. Themes discussed in these notes range from Tractarian refrains to later Wittgensteinian terms, and include topics such as phenomenology and mathematics. These notes provide evidence of a middle Wittgenstein period, and may help to define it. In the middle period of Wittgenstein's life, his thoughts on mathematics became more enigmatic. Several "isms" are attributed to his views on mathematics, such as verificationism, formalism, and finitism. It appears that his views on mathematics were constantly changing and not in a consistent way. Wittgenstein's influence on and by mathematicians is evident, and his views on mathematics changed substantially from his early and middle conceptions. Phenomenology and mathematics were quirky subjects in the middle Wittgenstein, but the more evident Wittgensteinian constructs of this period were logic, language, and method. Language was viewed as the connecting factor between the early and later Wittgenstein, either by discovering representational aspects or by deciphering the private language arguments. Analysis of linguistic phenomena as language games rather than tools of logic provided the transition from early to later Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein proposed a method of doing philosophy that is different from that of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, but still not the plurality of methods proposed in the Philosophical Investigations. This method involves turning to grammar as a way to avoid dogmatism and metaphysics. David Stern calls the early Wittgenstein's views on logic, language, and method "logical atomism" and the later Wittgenstein's "practical holism," with the middle Wittgenstein being "logical holism." After the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein's writings from 1946 until his death in 1951 constitute a distinctive phase of his thought, including texts such as Remarks on Colour, Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Zettel, On Certainty, and parts of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. Part II of the Philosophical Investigations was a point of contention, and is now seen as an almost independent entity. On Certainty is generally accepted as a work of epistemology, while Philosophical Investigations is usually recognized as dealing with psychology. Philosophical Investigations exhibits all the vagaries of Wittgensteinian interpretation, and the concept of "seeing aspects" is a key Wittgensteinian term. This concept involves noticing something about an object that one hadn't noticed before and thereby seeing it as something different, and it arises as a result of a change of context of our perceptions. On Certainty tackles skeptical doubts and foundational solutions, but is a work of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. Wittgenstein is seen as taking a non-skeptical stance on epistemology, believing in "hinge propositions" which cannot be doubted. This is related to the idea of the primacy of the deed over the word. The "third Wittgenstein" was identified by Danièle Moyal-Sharrock. In his later work, "Remarks on Colour", Wittgenstein attempts to clarify the language used to describe colours, and suggests that due to the indefiniteness of the concept of colour, the logic of colour concepts should be given piecemeal. He suggests that attention should be given to particularities such as the blending in of white, the coloured intermediary between two colours, and the difference between black-red-gold and black-red-yellow. This investigation looks at color phenomena, language used to describe them, philosophical methodology, and scientific inquiry. It is unique in that it was inspired by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "On the Theory of Colour". The writings of Wittgenstein's later period move away from the critical positions of the Investigations to a more positive perspective, but this does not necessarily mean a break from the later period. The question of interpreting Wittgenstein and whether there are continuities or breaks remains at the forefront of understanding Wittgenstein. Bibliography of Wittgenstein's works is included.
