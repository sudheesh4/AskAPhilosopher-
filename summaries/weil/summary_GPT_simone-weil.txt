Simone Weil (1909–1943) was a philosopher who explored truth and justice through her work in both academia and industry. Her work was value-centered and integrated, but not systematic, and it was composed of pieces for a variety of audiences. She was praised by some, such as Albert Camus, André Gide, Giorgio Agamben, and Hannah Arendt, but also criticized by others, such as Leon Trotsky and Charles de Gaulle. Simone Weil was born in Paris in 1909 to Jewish parents. She and her brother André were both educated at prestigious Parisian schools. Her first philosophy teacher, René Le Senne, introduced her to the idea that contradiction is a generative force for nuanced thinking. This entry focuses on her philosophical development, social-political philosophy, epistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, aesthetics, and reception and influence. In October 1925, Simone Weil began studying at Henri IV Lycée in preparation for the École Normale Supérieure entrance exams. She studied under the philosopher and essayist Émile-Auguste Chartier (known as Alain), who taught her intellectual history, philosophy, and literature. Weil developed her distinct mode of philosophizing in Alain's class, and in 1928 she became the first woman admitted to the École Normale. She received her _agrégation_ diploma in 1930 and taught at _lycées_ from 1931 to 1934. During this time, she taught philosophy to, lobbied for, and wrote on behalf of workers’ groups, and she also joined in manual labor. Her early thinking was influenced by Descartes, Marx, and Kant. Simone Weil traveled to Germany in 1932 to understand the conditions that led to Nazism. She observed that German trade unions were reformist and that long periods of unemployment had left many Germans without energy or esteem. In her 1934 essay "Reflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social Oppression", she used a Marxian method of analysis to critique bureaucracy and advocate for workers to understand their labor within the context of the whole organizational apparatus. She then applied for a sabbatical to work in Parisian factories as an unskilled female laborer. Simone Weil's 24 weeks of factory work in Paris was a major influence on her political philosophy and religious evolution. She experienced firsthand the brutality of modern industry, where orders from superiors and increased speeds of production led to fatigue and docility instead of rebellion. This experience of humiliation led her to recognize Christianity as the religion of slaves, and her conception and description of suffering thickened and became more personal. She participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and planned to return to factory work, but this was changed by the Spanish Civil War. Simone Weil was critical of both civil and international war, and she obtained journalist's credentials and joined an international anarchist brigade. She was severely burned in 1936, but her parents convinced her not to return to combat. She wrote against French colonization of Indochina and argued against French claims to Morocco and Tunisia. In 1937, she visited Italy and had her second significant contact with Christianity. From 1937-1938, she revisited her Marxian commitments and rejected any positing of revolution as immanent or determined. During Easter 1938, she visited the Benedictine abbey of Solesmes and had her third contact with Christianity, finding joy in Gregorian chant and understanding the possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction. Simone Weil was introduced to the poet George Herbert at Solesmes and experienced Christ's presence while reciting his poem "Love". She believed God had prevented her from reading the mystics until that point. After the military alliance of Germany and Italy in May 1939, Weil renounced her pacifism and left Paris with her family in June 1940. In Vichy France, she sought to apprentice herself to the life of agricultural laborers and was introduced to the Dominican priest Joseph-Marie Perrin. Through Perrin, she began to consider the question of baptism and worked in the grape harvest in the Ardéche region in Fall 1941. Simone Weil worked as a laborer in France for eight hours a day, but was treated differently than the other laborers. She left France in 1942 to go to New York, where she filled notebooks with philosophical, theological, and mathematical considerations. She then moved to London, where she wrote 800 pages in four months. She died in August 1943, and the coroner declared it a suicide due to self-starvation and tuberculosis. Her grave was originally anonymous and thought to be a pauper's grave for fifteen years. Simone Weil wrote from the left and continually revised her social-political philosophy in light of changing material conditions. She was consistent in her attention to and theorizing from the situation of the oppressed and marginalized. Her early essays on politics focused on providing an analysis of the real causes of oppression to inform militants in revolutionary action. Weil argued that the division of labor or the existence of material privilege alone is not a sufficient condition for her concept of "oppression". She believed that the intervention of the struggle for power generates oppression, and that it weighs as pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey. Simone Weil's concept of oppression is based on the struggle for power and the structure of labor, which limits individuals from experiencing the world to their full potential. She also believes that privilege, which includes money, arms, and knowledge, exacerbates oppression in modern societies. Weil argued that modern bureaucracy is a new form of oppression, which is characterized by official language, caste privileges, and a division of labor that does not involve engaged thinking. Simone Weil critiques modern society's oppressive collectivity and the idea of revolution as an inversion of forces, which she sees as an empty word. She proposes a regulative ideal of revolution that involves attention to reality and a dialectical relation between revolutionary alternatives and present praxis. Freedom is a unity of thought and action, and a freeing mode of production would involve meaningful relations to thinking and to others throughout the course of labor. Simone Weil's "Factory Journal" from 1934-1935 suggests a shift in her social-political philosophy, deepening her political pessimism. Her notion of freedom shifted from a negative freedom from constraints to a positive freedom to obey, which she referred to as "consent". She called for individuals to think critically and to introduce play into the bureaucratic machine, in order to promote liberty and deny the "social idol". Her ideal society was one in which manual labor, understood and performed by thinking individuals, was a "pivot" toward liberty. Simone Weil experienced humiliation and oppression in the factories, which informed her concept of "affliction" - a combination of physical pain, psychological agony, and social degradation. She advocated for reform in the factories and argued against fascism and war, believing that wars are absurd and have no definable objective. She argued that ideologies and capitalized words such as "Nation" and "State" have taken on the role of the phantom in the modern world. Simone Weil argued that power relies on prestige, which is an illusion and without limit. To combat this, she prescribed distinguishing between the imaginary and the real and defining words properly and precisely. This amounts to a critique of ideology and its political rhetoric. Weil desired a kind of equilibrium between forces instead of an endless pursuit of an illusion of absolute stability and security. She defined politics as the double perspective between the real conditions of social equilibrium and the movements of collective imagination. In her essay "The Iliad or the Poem of Force" (1940), Simone Weil provides an explication of the concept of "force" from a position of exile and antisemitic marginalization. This essay was widely read during her lifetime and was her first essay to appear in English. Weil argues that the protagonist of the Iliad is not Achilles or Hector, but force itself, which reifies and dehumanizes no matter if one wields or undergoes it. She also states that force includes not only coercion, but also prestige, and that each individual is informed by social values and features the operations of force through accidental characteristics. Simone Weil argued that force is the key to history, and that it can destroy not only bodies, but also values and cultures. In her later writings, she developed the concept of force as "the force that kills" and as a specific kind of violence. During her time in London, she wrote several pieces, including "Draft for a Statement of Human Obligations" and "Note on the General Suppression of Political Parties", which argued for the abolition of political parties. Her major work from this period was "The Need for Roots". Simone Weil wrote an essay called "La Personne et le sacré" in which she critiques "rights" and proposes "obligation" and "justice" as counter-terms. In her book "The Need for Roots", she adds "needs of the soul" as another counter-balance to rights. Weil's concept of morality is based on compassion and obligations to another, and her sense of justice is not based on human rationality, but on a desire for the Good. Her goal is for cultures to continue their own traditions, and her concept of "roots" is crucial to her late political thought, as it conceptualizes human society as dynamic and living while emphasizing the need for stability and security. Simone Weil's concept of roots serves as a bridge between the reality of society and the ideal of supernatural justice. It allows for the development of the individual with a view toward God or eternal values, and enables multiple relations to the world that nourish the individual and the community. Weil points to war, colonization, money, and contemporary education as forces that uproot human life, and describes modern uprootedness as a threat to the human soul. Education is corrupted by capitalism and a Roman inheritance for cultivating prestige with respect to the nation. Simone Weil's later writings suggest a civilization based on free labor, which allows for direct contact with reality and is informed by her Christian Platonism. She argues that knowledge of the world requires rigorous, balanced thinking, even if it leads to difficult tasks. Labor's consent to natural forces is consent to God, and its kenotic activity is an imitation of Christ. Weil also suggests that spirituality must be drawn from the social environment, reversing her earlier emphasis on individual thinking. Simone Weil's epistemology was shaped by her social-political and religious thought, and was influenced by various traditions such as ancient Greek philosophy and tragedies, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. She argued for the existence of self, God, and world, and believed that self-knowledge was capability always qualified by the acknowledgment that one is not God. Weil was initially critical of sensations as grounds for knowledge, and problematized the imagination as a barrier between mind and reality. Her epistemology was informed by her studies of Descartes, Kant, and Plato, while positioning her against Aristotle. Simone Weil was critical of any universalized reading of the world and saw the imagination as a way to extend the self. She developed an intersubjective epistemology which required suspending one's own perspective to allow reality to appear on its own terms. Weil's concept of contradiction went beyond logical conjunctions and she argued that incommensurables could be reconciled on a higher plane. This led to her late epistemology of mystery, which had theological implications. Simone Weil believed that contradictions can be understood as mysteries, allowing for the coexistence of affliction and God. She was inspired by the Pythagorean idea of harmony, which holds that mathematics can be a bridge between the natural and eternal. Weil argued that contradictions should be presented honestly and tested on different levels, as they are "the criterion of the real". She used the example of Christ's command to "love your enemies" as a contradiction in value, as it requires loving those who are detestable and threaten vulnerability. Weil's philosophy of contradiction is more Pythagorean or Platonic than Marxian, taking up contradiction through dialectics on the level of thought. She also believes that reading is a form of interpretation of physical sensations and social conditions, and that readings are mediated through other readings. Simone Weil uses the metaphor of a blind man's stick to explain how we can expand our awareness and sensitivity by reading a situation through attention to another. However, readings can become narrow and simplistic, and can be used as a form of power and control. Weil connects reading to war and imagination, and argues that all action on others is essentially changing what they read. She also suggests that we are not simply passive in our readings, and that we should contemplate insoluble contradictions. Simone Weil advocates for a science that is conducted with mathematical precision and in close relationship with religious faith. This kind of science would allow for contemplation of the natural world on multiple levels, understanding that the order of the world is the same as a unity, but different on its myriad levels. Weil's epistemology is an anti-modern project, as it rejects the idea that the world should be subject to human power and autonomy. Simone Weil's ethical concept of "attention" is an orientation that requires an apprenticeship leading to a capacity of discernment on multiple levels. It involves discerning someone's suffering, the protest of someone harmed, the social conditions that cause suffering, and the fact that one can be equally a subject of affliction. Attention is not directed by will, but by a desire without an object. Weil's epistemology relies on a time-out-of-mind metaphysics for justification, and labor (especially physical labor) assumes an epistemological role by subjecting the individual to necessity and allowing for a more balanced reading. Simone Weil's essay "Reflections on the Right use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God" (1942) discusses the concept of attention as a kind of vigilance, involving suspending thought and leaving it empty and ready to receive the object that is to penetrate it. Attention is a "negative effort" that involves releasing egoistic projects and desires and growing receptivity of the mind, and is oriented towards the mysterious good that "draws God down". It is important to avoid searching or willing, as this can lead to settling too quickly on something false or idolatrous. Attention is characterized by suspension and detachment, and its acceptance marks individual fragility and mortality. Weil's concept of "decreation" is a self-emptying of the ego in order to receive the world without interference. This is an imitation of Christ's kenosis and allows for an intersubjective ethics. Attention is rare but necessary for any ethical disposition, exemplified by the parable of the Good Samaritan. Attention is a creative renunciation of one's own power in order to give existence to another being. Simone Weil's ethics of attention is distinct from canonical conceptualizations of ethics, as it is not motivated by duty or assessed by its consequences. It is closer to virtue ethics than deontology or consequentialism, but differs in its spontaneous emergence, active-passive orientation, excessive generosity, supernatural inspiration, lack of teleology, and lack of a sense of the impersonal good. Weil connects attention, void, and love in her supernatural (Christian Platonic) metaphysics. Simone Weil argues that love is consenting to the rule of mechanical necessity in matter and free choice in the soul. Attention can be seen as love, as it requires the recognition of a reality outside of the self. Weil allows for one exception to the duty of loving universally, which is friendship. Friendship is a personal and human love that is pure and reflects divine love, and is a union of opposites: necessity/subordination and liberty/equality. This concept of friendship advances Weil's critiques of capitalism, bureaucracy, and colonialism. Simone Weil's ethics of attention is an essential ingredient of all human relations that are not degraded or abusive. It involves loving a human being as we would like to be loved, and it is an antidote to force. Attention also manifests as independent, detached thought and suggests that knowing the reality of the world is a gift of grace, rather than an individual achievement. It resists the natural tendency of humans to seek control and dominance over others. Simone Weil's later metaphysical and religious philosophy was a combination of Christian and Platonic thought. She proposed an original creation theology in which God, as purely good, infinite, and eternal, withdrew so that something else (something less than fully good, finite, and spatio-temporally determinate) could exist, namely, the universe. This principle of contingency, the "web of determinations" contrary to God, is "necessity". Weil's Christian inflection of this is the "supreme contradiction" between creature and creator, which is unified by Christ. Out of love for the world and its creatures, God decided to be lesser. Simone Weil's religious philosophy is based on the idea that existence is a mark of God's love, and that humans should imitate God by renouncing their autonomy and power out of love for God and the world. This is known as "decreation" and is paradoxically described as "passive activity" and "non-active action". Weil's concept of "intermediaries" or "metaxu" suggests that God is indirectly present in the world through beauty, cultural traditions, law, and labor, and that reality itself is a form of mediation. Simone Weil's concept of the real is an obstacle that represents contradiction, which thought must transform into correlation or mysterious and crucifying relation. She distinguishes the real from the imaginary, which can lead to idolatry or self-satisfaction. To allow the real and others to give themselves, she suggests decreation and atheism as a form of purification. Love is pure when it is anonymous and universal. Weil's concept of necessity includes physical and social forces, and enslavement to forces outside our control is woven into the human condition. Time is a form of necessity, and Weil's Christian Platonism is reflected in her metaphors of the Cave and the Cross. By 1942, Weil was against the notion of progress, and believed that abandoning the notion of chronology was necessary to find Eternity. Simone Weil argues that progress does not necessarily imply improvement, as the Good is eternal and non-existent. She believes that suffering is a form of redemption, and that sin is an attempt to escape time. Weil also suggests that monotony can be beautiful when it reflects eternity, and that the world has order behind necessity and God behind order. She further states that gravity is the force of the natural world that subjects all created beings, while grace is the counter-balance that provides supernatural bread to satiate the human void. The cross is a symbol of the intersection of necessity and grace. Simone Weil's concept of necessity is connected to her late conceptualization of the subject, which sees the self as exempt from necessity. Weil's view of freedom is not based on agency, but on obedience and consent to divine will. Consent is a kind of reconciliation between the necessary and the good, and love must be vulnerable and defenseless in the face of evil. Weil's aesthetic philosophy is primarily Kantian and Platonic, and she believes that beauty is a snare set by God to trap the soul. Simone Weil's concept of beauty is a realist one, in which beauty is seen as a contact of impersonal good with the faculty of sense, and a link between mind, body, world, and universe. It is a disinterested interestedness, a Platonic orientation of the soul to the contemplation of the good, and a gesture towards transcendental goodness. Beauty is a testament to and manifestation of the inflexible necessity of the natural world, and through it, necessity becomes the object of love. Beauty is an intermediary between the fragile contingency of time and an eternal reality, and it serves as an implicit love of God. Beauty is found in nature, art, and science, and it trains the soul to be detached and to transcend the perspective of one's own project. Simone Weil's aesthetic commitments are reflected in her style, which is sharp and excludes her own voice. Her concepts have been carried on through her contemporaries and heirs. The influence of Simone Weil's generation of French thinkers can be seen in the writings of Maurice Blanchot, Georges Bataille, and Emmanuel Levinas. Jacques Derrida was interested in her mysticism and atheism in his younger years, but left her behind in his later references. Weil's limited influence on post-structuralists may be due to her not surviving World War II and her position as a woman philosopher leading to ad hominem attacks. Her "negative politics" and concepts of decreation, impersonality, and force have been taken up by Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito, while her Christian Platonism has influenced Iris Murdoch's emphasis on the good, metaphysics, and morality. Simone Weil's religious and ethical philosophies have been noted to have a "spiritual kinship" with those of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Her writings on affliction and beauty in relation to justice have been influential on Elaine Scarry's writings, and her concepts have been cited as an inspiration by T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery O'Connor, Susan Sontag, and Anne Carson. The Anglo-American secondary literature on Weil has focused on her concept of supernatural justice, Christian Platonism, and her concepts of force, radicalism, science and divinity, suffering and trauma, decreation and ethics, identity, political theology, animality, and international relations.
